        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>As this page describes, my name is Jakob London. I commute to Lewis University from Lockport every day.
            I am currently double majoring in computer science and mathematics. I am also in the 
            computer science 4+1 program, as I am planning on completing a computer science masters degree
            with a concentration in artificial intelligence.

        <h3>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h3>
        <p>I enjoy playing all kinds of video games in my free time. The kinds of games I enjoy are quite
            diverse, but here are some aspects I personally enjoy in the games is play. I enjoy competitive 
            games in which teamwork is critical to winning. I quite enjoy puzzle games (I highly recommend 
            Baba is You, which uses logic similar to programming and will destroy your brain!).

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p>
            Last summer I completed a summer research internship under the mentorship of Dr. Harsy. This research examined the differences in how 
            top tennis and Counter Strike competitive players deal with pressure when compared to the rest of the competitive field. This research
            was presented at the MAA MathFest annual conference in Philadelphia to a select group of judges, winning an honorable mention.
